### Cache Feed Use Case

#### Data:
- Feed items

#### Primary course(happy path):
✅ Execute "Save Feed Items" command with above data.
✅ System deletes old cache data.
3. System encodes feed items.
4. System timestamps the new data.
5. System saves new cache data.
6. System delivers success message.

#### Deleting error course (sad path):
1. System delivers error.

#### Saving error course (sad path):
1. System delivers error.


####4 Timestamp
1. The current date/time is not a pure function
   (every time you create a Date instance, it has a different value-the current date & time)
   
2. Instead of letting the Use Case produce the current date via the impure Date.init() function directly,
   we can move this responsibility to a collaborator (a simple closure in this case),
   and inject it as a dependency. Then we can easily control the current date/time during tests.
